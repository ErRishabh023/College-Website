                If we think about the broadest engineering discipline, the one and only one name comes in the mind is mechanical engineering. Mechanical engineering is the branch which helps to design, develop, manufacture and test any component, machine or the things which are static or which can move but made by the humankind. Mechanical engineering provides the knowledge by virtue of which any machine can be designed to work safely, efficiently and reliably all at a competitive cost. Mechanical engineering focuses on creating the products which can fulfil the human needs in modern life. Probably every product or service used by the human being is some way touched by a mechanical engineer. As far as utility of this branch is concerned, it provides solutions in the field of energy, transportation, health care, aviation, space exploration and many more. Mechanical engineer designs from molecules to large and complex system, from the smallest components to largest components and machines. For completing the difficult task of shaping an idea into reality there is the need of creativity, knowledge and analytical tools which is served by only and only the branch known as mechanical engineering. Mechanical engineers have a lot of opportunities which is created by the breadth of their subjects.

                Faculty members of mechanical engineering department are well qualified and most of them are IITians, NITians and industry experts. They usually attend several faculty development programs to enhance their skills and knowledge.
